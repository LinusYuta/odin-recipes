    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality. 
        Youâ€™ll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak; seared and caramelized on the outside, and so juicy inside.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>New York Steak</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Rosemary</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
        <li>Just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
        <li>Add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
        <li>Melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs.</li>
        <li>Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
    </ol>
